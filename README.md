# SEAMS-2024-Supplemental materials (anonymously uploaded)

## Includes:

(1) **Query terms:** We devised specific sets of search phrases to automatically identify and extract discussions about anomalies from forum posts. For each of the 18 identified types of anomalies, a tailored set of query terms was created. Multiple query terms, when connected by a conjunction "+", must appear within a specified proximity to each other to trigger a match. Additionally, we formulated a collection of 'nullifier-terms.' The presence of these nullifier-terms in close proximity to a query term counteracts its effect, thereby negating the match. The nullifiers are appended in the last column in the same file. 


(2) **Test dataset:** Links and ground truth anomalies of the forum discussions that were used for evaluating the detection accuracy of the framework. This can be used for replication.
